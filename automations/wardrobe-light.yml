mode: queued

# Slightly longer description:
# I have a smart light and a motion sensor in our walk-in wardrobe.
# Both of these are made by IKEA and set up through Zigbee2MQTT.
# This automation looks for the state of the motion sensor changing, and
# switches on the light when detected. The light's brightness value is 
# dynamic too, according to the logic in the brightness variable.

trigger:
  # trigger this automation when any motion is detected
